1) Download dropbox application
2) Put remoteAction.ahk in a separate folder within the local dropbox directory on your computer
3) Run remoteAction.ahk (Optional - make a shortcut of it in the startup folder so that this script runs on computer startup)
4) Make another directory labeled "remoteAction_ran" in the same directory
5) Make any commands you'd like in an ahk file labeled "dummy.ahk" and place them in the same directory as remoteAction.ahk
6) Set timer by changing the seconds in remoteAction.ahk
