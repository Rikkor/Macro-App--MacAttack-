# Macro_App__MacAttack__
I re-uploaded this into my github in case anything ever happens to the original as it was in another group member's github.

This was worked on by 3 of us, and I was one of the members.

This app allows people to send macros from the android app to any computer they have logged into Dropbox as long as the script (downloadable from the app) for Autohotkey has been set up. The delay can be set by the user as well.
